Retrofitting data science

Statistics + Engineering + Communication

Unsupervised often helps supervised



## HomeAway data projects

- Ranking
- Inventory Optimization
- Geolocation Services (GeoPandas)
- Identify Unfair Practices
- Revenue Management
- Marketing Ad Spend
- Shopping Cycle Segmentation (Very sparse data)
- Content Generation (Deep Learning)
- Image Quality
- Bot Detection

## Ranking and Relevance

- Matching problem (Stable marriage problem)
- PPB? Pay-per-booking
- Gradient Boosted Trees
- Static feature engineering (How many features?)

## Now what?

 - Need to get it in production
 
## Two Data Science Environments

### Experimentation
 - Flexibility
 - Feature Engineering
 - Model Tuning
 
### Production
 - Fault-tolerant
 - Secure
 - Monitoring
 - Real-time
 - Reproducible
 - Deployment
 
## Way Back

 - Write everything  in C++
 - Double overhead for every new feature added
 - Version issues

### Advantages
 - Better performance
 - Integration
 
### Disadvantages
 - Error prone
 - Slow

## Predictive Model Markup Language
 - Can  be generated from Python and R
 - May limit model representations

## Microservices Architecture

 - Can develop experimental models
 - Containerize everything
 - Isolates services
 - WAR(?)
 - Supports more model types
 - Adds network latency
 - Need Dev Ops
 - Protocol Buffers?

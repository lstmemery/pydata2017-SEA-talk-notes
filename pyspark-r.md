# Scalable Data Science with Python/R and Spark

Data Science PySpark
 - ML Pipeline API
 - tensorframe, BigDL
 
## Ways to use Spark

### ETL
 - SQL
 - Leveraging Catalyst Optimizer
 
## Language Bindings

### PySpark
 - Integrates with pandas
 - uses cloudpickle to serialize
 - Py4J (Would it make sense to use Jython?)
 
### SparkR

 - similar to dplyr
 - R-JVM bridge (propriety)

## High Performance
 - Is there any reason to learn Scala?
 
## ML/DL 
 - End-to-end machine learning pipeline
 - Spark works great for ETL

 - Can train model elsewhere and then add to cluster
 
## Spark ML Pipeline
- Looks like scikit-learn
